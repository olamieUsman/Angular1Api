The application should have;
1. A view where new users can be created. 
2. A view where all users are displayed. Each listed user should have a link to his posts and another link to his albums. Ability to filter users by name.
3. A view to view comments of each post and be able to order the comments by email

NB:
All API calls must be implemented in services/factories, then the services called from the controller
Donâ€™t waste time on the look and feel of the app.
